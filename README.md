# BuildABot

BuildABot is an application focused on lowering the barriers to entry for pc building. We as recently graduated junior devs have gained a sharp interest in computers, seeing their brilliance, but as well as their limitations. We all had the great passion of creating our own computers, but felt that the learning curve is still too steep for new builders. As such we aimed to build an application that would facilitate the computer part selection process.

## The Creators:

Dylson - https://github.com/Dylson14 \
Rahma - https://github.com/rahmaabdul \

## Challenges:

* Losing a teammate
* GraphQL
* Connecting Front-End to Back-end


## Successes:

* Phenomenal Communication.
* Getting a grasp at how to deal with upcoming problems, and how to work on them together
* We created a methodical approach to solving problems step by step

## Application Requirements
* Use React for the front end.
* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
* Have a polished UI.
* Be responsive.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Include authentication (JWT).
* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).
* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Overall

This was the most challening aspect of our bootcamp, regardless of the challenges we had faced we always faced them with positive outlook and from the lens of a learning opportunity. Overall we plan to continue to work on our skills to fully complete the application.
